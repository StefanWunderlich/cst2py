# cst2py
Python scripts to extract E-fields form CST simulations and calculate parameters for stochastic cooling 

### fields.py
Read field results from the "2D/3D Results"-Folder in CST.

This code uses the "Result Reader DLL". From 2019 on, it is not documented in the CST help any more, but still provided. One is supposed to use the export methods of CST instead, but still allowed to ask the support.

### curves.py
Import/Export CST curves. 
The data are in "CST XY Data Exchange Format V2", as copied from the "1D Results"-Folder in CST. 
Can be copied direclty from the windows clipboard. 
Currently, only single curves can be processed.

### sc.py
- Import E-Fields from hdf5-files (which have been generated by fields.py)
- Calculate kicker constants and kicker shunt impedances
- rotate phase of K(f) (add or remove wire length)
- calculate beam parameters like beta, momentum, energy...
